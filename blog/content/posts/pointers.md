## Pointers

Pointers provide a way to share data across program boundaries. Having the ability to share and reference data with a pointer provides the benefit of efficiency. There is only one copy of the data and everyone can see it changing. The cost is that anyone can change the data which can cause side effects in running programs.

## Notes

* Use pointers to share data.
* Values in Go are always pass by value.
* "Value of", what's in the box. "Address of" ( **&** ), where is the box.
* The (*) operator declares a pointer variable and the "Value that the pointer points to".

## Escape Analysis

* When a value could be referenced after the function that constructs the value returns.
* When the compiler determines a value is too large to fit on the stack.
* When the compiler doesnâ€™t know the size of a value at compile time.
* When a value is decoupled through the use of function or interface values.
